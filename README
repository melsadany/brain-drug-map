Drug development is a multifaceted endeavor necessitating a thorough comprehension of the intricate biological mechanisms governing drug effects. A pivotal aspect of drug development is pinpointing brain regions activated by drugs, either therapeutically or in terms of side effects. In this study, we present a novel approach to construct a brain activity map, showcasing the activation intensity of diverse brain regions in response to specific drugs.

The Allen Institute offers an extensive dataset of microarray gene expression profiles across various brain regions, accompanied by their spatial coordinates in the MNI-space. As this dataset covers only specific brain regions, we devised a deep learning model to predict gene expression in unmeasured regions (i.e., imputation). Subsequently, we established correlations between gene expression metrics and drug transcriptomic signatures from the LINCS project, quantifying each brain region's response to the drug.

To interpret the possible functional changes within the brain based on predicted drug maps, we integrated feature space data from the Neurosynth dataset. To validate our findings, we compared our tool's predictions with literature results for methylphenidate (MPH), demonstrating congruent patterns of regional activation. We observed that the patterns of regional activation predicted by our approach closely aligned with the functional connectivity changes linked to methylphenidate in the literature.

The implications of the resulting brain activity map are profound for drug development and personalized medicine. By developing a predictive tool for anticipating brain region activation in response to drugs, our research streamlines drug discovery, economizes time and resources, and enhances drug safety through side effect prediction. This methodology bridges the gap between genomics and neurology, providing a holistic understanding of how drugs modulate brain activity.
